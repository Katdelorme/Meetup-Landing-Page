# Meetup Landing Page
This repository is for a landing page designed around the idea of catering to a meetup that hosts events, take in new members, and displays their information.

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation with a multi-section landing page. The navigation's programmatically built. Items clicked in the navigation scroll to their corresponding anchors. When a section is in view, an active state's shown. It combines Javascript, HTML, and CSS to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience.
